1. THE Arrogancy of REASON against Divine Relations, Repressed.

    _ Object. But we must not believe all things; and therefore we must enquire, and try the spirits, whether they be of God, or not, even the Spirit of Christ himself?

    _ Object. But would you not have men satisfyed of the reasonableness of what they believe? shall men believe that which is unreasonable? this were to make us mad, and not Christians.

    _ Object. But it is certain that God never spok• contradictions. Therefore if I finde contradictions in the Scriptures, may I not rationally argue that they are not the Word of God?

    _ Object. 1. You tell us out of Scripture, that ther• are Devils, most wicked malicious spirits addict〈…〉 to do evil: Who made these Devils, or, how can they to be so bad: Certainly, God is good, and therefore made nothing but what was good; and ever• thing must have a first cause: If they made themselves evil, then they were the first cause of thei• own evil: And then you deifie the will of th• Devil in making it to be absolutely a first cause. •• you say as some, That sin is but a privation, and therefore hath no efficient cause, but a deficient 〈…〉 then either that deficiency must be first from Go• (and then he should be the first cause of all sin) or from the will of the Devil; and then either he wa• before bound non-deficere, or not. If not, it was no sin; if he were, then first, he could primo deficere, though God did all that belonged to him to prevent it; secondly, and he could have stood without any more help then he had when he fell, and so quoad determinationem propriae voluntatis, should have been the first determining cause of his own perseverance, or non-deficiency: For if he could not stand, it was no sin to fall, being before innocent. Moreover, their sin was not a meer privation, but materially an act (whether velle or nolle) and formally a relation of disconformity to the Law.

    _ Object. 2.•he Scripture saith, That God made all things of nothing; when of nothing, nothing can be made. How then can these things be?

    _ Object. 3. Moses saith, That God made the light, and day, and darkness, and night, before the Sun: When the light is the effect, and the Sun the cause; and the darkness is but a privation of the light of the Sun. How then can these things be?

    _ Object 4. M•s•• saith Gen. 1 16. That God made two great Lights, the Sun and Moon; whereas it is certain▪ th〈…〉 many 〈◊〉 Plan••s are greater then the Mo••, therefore he speaketh ignoran•ly.

    _ Object. 5. M•s•s makes the Garden of Eden to have a Riv•• arising i• it, which •ivideth it self into four parts. But there is no such place now known in the world, where four such Rivers as he describeth are so near.

    _ Object. 6. Is it a likely thing that a Serpent should speak to Eve? Or the subtilty of the Serpent be a reason of the Temptation? Or, that Eve that was then perfect, should not know that Serpents cannot speak of themselves; and if she knew that it was the Devil that spak• by the Serpent, it would have affrighted and astonished her, rather then have been such a temptation to her?

    _ Obj.—. How could a•n f•ye into the Land of Nod, or build a City, G••. 4. 6, 17. when there was no more m•n •••••th▪

    _ O••. 8. Is it • likely thing that the Red-Sea should 〈…〉 for the Israelites to pass through? Or that 〈…〉 should stand still in Joshuahs time: and not 〈…〉 be over tu•ned by it? Or that Jonas
should live without ayre in the belly of a Whale? Or •ot be digested in his belly as other food is? How •an these things be?

    _ Obj. 9. Is it a lik•ly thing that a Virgin should conceive and have a child? How can this be?

    _ Obj. 10. Is it a likely thing that God should become a man, or that God and man should be one person, which is more Condescen•ion then for a Prince to become a flye to save flyes ••om being killed?

    _ Obj 11. Is it not a contradiction to say that there are three per•ons, and but one God?

    _ Object. 12. There are many contradictions in t• Scripture; and therefore it is incredible. For e•ample; Mark. 14. 30. [Before the Cock Cro• twice] Mat. and Luke say [Before the Cock Crow• And many the like.
